# Cipher algorithms-project
Cipher algorithms-project is a website built using html , css and javascript with responsive that provides 7 encryption algorithms for decoding and encoding text. The app is developed by  Nada Hamdy, a software engineer and computer science student at Suez Canal University, as a practical discussion of cyber security subject in faculty of computer informatics Suez Canal University.

#Features

The project explores different Cipher algorithms, including the Caesar Cipher, autokey Cipher, Playfair Cipher,railfevce Cipher,polyalphabetic Cipher,monoalphabetic Cipher ,and DES Cipher .
. Each Cipher has a detailed explanation of how it works and how to use it, as well as an interactive tool where you can encrypt and decrypt messages using the algorithm and custom validation for inputs.

I had a lot of fun building this project and learned a lot about encryption and web development in the process. I hope you'll check it out and let me know what you think.

Encryption Algorithms


DES
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher that uses a 56-bit key. It operates on 64-bit blocks of data and is widely used for encryption of electronic data. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides DES encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.

Monoalphabetic
Monoalphabetic substitution is a simple substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is replaced by another letter. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Monoalphabetic encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.

Caesar
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the plaintext by a certain number of positions. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Caesar encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.

Playfair
The Playfair cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters instead of individual letters. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Playfair encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.

Polyalphabetic
Polyalphabetic substitution is a cipher that uses multiple substitution alphabets. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Polyalphabetic encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.

Autokey
The Autokey cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses the plaintext itself as the key for encryption. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Autokey encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.

Realfence
The Realfence cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the characters of the plaintext according to a numeric key. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Realfence encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.
